# Existing Customer Team - Time Tracker
Since the start of Coronavirus lock-down, members of the Existing Customer Team
(ECT) at Butternut Box were forced to work from home and for some, from their
country of origin.

Dealing with worldwide time difference would therefore become tricky for members
of the ECT to understand when one of their colleagues were online or not and
would involve them having to remember the exact hour difference between
different time zones.

This app was built to help members of the ECT understand what the time is for
their fellow team mates and solves the problem of remembering each individual
time difference amount.
