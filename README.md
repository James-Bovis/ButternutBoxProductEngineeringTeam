# Butternut Box Product Engineering - Time Zone Tracker

Since the start of Coronavirus pandemic, members of the Butternut Box Product
Engineering team were forced to work from home and for some... from their
country of origin.

Dealing with worldwide time difference would therefore become tricky for
team members as it would be difficult to work out whether one of their
colleagues were online or not and would involve them having to remember the
exact hour difference between different time zones.

This app was built to help the members of the Product Engineering team to
understand what the time is for their fellow team mates and solves the problem
of working out a team members local time.

Courtesy of the [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/web), this app also provides
the following features:

- A 'presence' indicator to show whether a particular team member is set to
  `Away` or `Active` in Slack
- Given what time zone the team member is currently in, display that country's
  flag as an icon.
- A written description of a team members current timezone
- The team members current Slack avatar picture
